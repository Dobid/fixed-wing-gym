# gym-fixed-wing

The Fixed-Wing aircraft environment is an [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) wrapper for the 
[PyFly](https://github.com/eivindeb/pyfly) flight simulator, adding several features on top of the base simulator,
such as target states. This environment allows training and learning of reinforcement learning controllers for 
fixed-wing aircraft.
